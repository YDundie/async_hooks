# Explanation of Async Hooks in Node.js

This code demonstrates how to use Async Hooks in Node.js to provide a context object that can be accessed throughout the lifecycle of a request.

## Async Hooks

Async Hooks is a feature in Node.js that provides a way to track the lifecycle of asynchronous operations. With Async Hooks, developers can create a context object that can be passed along between different parts of an application, making it easy to share state between them.

Async Hooks is a relatively low-level feature of Node.js, and its usage can be complex. However, it provides a lot of flexibility and can be used to solve various problems, including debugging, profiling, and resource management.

## Code Explanation

This code consists of two files: `index.js` and `context.js`.

### `context.js`

In this file, we define the `contexts` Map, which will be used to store the context object associated with each async operation. We also define the `async_hooks` object, which is used to enable Async Hooks.

The `asyncHook` object is created using the `async_hooks.createHook` method. It defines two methods: `init` and `destroy`. The `init` method is called whenever a new async operation is started, and the `destroy` method is called when the operation is finished.

In the `init` method, we check whether the async operation is an incoming HTTP request. If it is, we create a new context object and store it in the `contexts` Map using the async operation's ID.

In the `destroy` method, we remove the context object associated with the async operation from the `contexts` Map.

Finally, we enable the Async Hooks using the `asyncHook.enable()` method.

### `index.js`

In this file, we create an Express.js application and import the `contexts` and `async_hooks` objects from `context.js`.

The `contextProvider` middleware function is defined, which sets a property called `jwt` on the context object. This property is set to a string that combines the number `123` with the current timestamp.

The `contextCleanup` function is defined, which is responsible for cleaning up the context objects after each request. It loops through all the context objects in the `contexts` Map and calls the `destroy` method on each one. It also removes the context object from the `contexts` Map.

The `contextProvider` middleware function is added to the Express.js application using the `app.use` method, which means that it will be executed for each incoming request.

The `/test` route is defined, which simply returns the `jwt` property of the context object.

Finally, the server is started using the `app.listen` method.

## How to Use Async Hooks in Requests

By using Async Hooks, we can easily maintain a context object that can be accessed throughout the lifecycle of a request. This can be useful when you need to pass data between different parts of your application, such as between middleware functions.

To use Async Hooks in requests, you can define a middleware function that sets properties on the context object. These properties can then be accessed in subsequent middleware functions and route handlers.

For example, if you want to check whether a user is authenticated in a route handler, you can define a middleware function that checks the authentication status and sets a `user` property on the context object. You can then access this `user` property in the route handler to determine whether the user is authenticated.
